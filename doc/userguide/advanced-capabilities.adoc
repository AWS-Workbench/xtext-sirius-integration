=== Using a Different Grammar for Editing Model Contents

For editing model contents, we might use a grammar that differs from the one used for model serialization.

A typical use-case may allow to change the order of features in order to allow only a subset of them to be modified.

.Example

As an example, assume the following Xtext grammar snippet:
[source, antlr]
----
grammar org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.Statemachine with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate statemachine "http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/example/fowlerdsl/Statemachine"

Statemachine :
     {Statemachine}
	('events' 
		events+=Event+ 
	'end')?

	// ...
;

Event:
	name=ID code=INT? ('[' guard=Guard ']')?
;

// ...

----

In our editor, we want the end-user to edit only the `name` and `guard` features of `Event`. This is not possible with the given grammar, as `code` is placed between them.

To solve this, we create a new language:
[source, antlr]
----
grammar org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.InlineEdit with org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.Statemachine

import "http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/example/fowlerdsl/Statemachine" 
import "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore" as ecore

InlineStatemachine returns Statemachine:   <1>
	Statemachine
;

//@Override                                <2>
Event:
	name=ID ('[' guard=Guard ']')? code=INT?
;

----
<1> We have to have a root rule, because Xtext uses the first rule as entry rule. We just forward to the original root rule.
<2> Newer Xtext version know the `@Override` annotation to redefine a rule.

This creates a grammar (for the identical metamodel) that serializes features `name` and `guard` adjacent to each other, so we can limit the editor to them.


.Details

The editing grammar must fulfill the following criteria:

* based on identical metamodel
* has same root element
* contains rules for all semantic elements also covered by the original grammar (either inherited or self-implemented)
* must serialize correctly from a model without any previous textual representation

We might need to <<forceWhitespaceSerializer, fix serialization issues>> in this approach.



[[forceWhitespaceSerializer]]
=== Force Serialization of Whitespaces

If we experience serialization issues, namely keywords get merged resulting in invalid syntax, we can use a workaround provided by `com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime` plug-in.

Typical symptoms of this issue include invalid auto-completion suggestions in the editor and exceptions on committing the changed elements.

To fix this, register the following classes to the editing language:

[source, java]
----
public class InlineEditRuntimeModule extends org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.AbstractInlineEditRuntimeModule {

	public Class<? extends IHiddenTokenSequencer> bindIHiddenTokenSequencer() {
		return com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime.serializer.ForceWhitespaceBetweenKeywordsHiddenTokenSequencer.class;
	}

	public Class<? extends TextRegionAccessBuilder> bindTextRegionAccessBuilder() {
		return com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime.serializer.ForceWhitespaceBetweenKeywordsTextRegionAccessBuilder.class;
	}
	
}
----


[[forceIgnoredFeaturesTransient]]
=== Force Ignored Nested Features to be Transient

Especially if we <<ignoredNestedFeatures, ignored nested features>>, we might need to adjust the serializer to be able to provide a suitable <<specialEditGrammar, adjusted grammar>>.

.Example

Assume the following Xtext grammar snippet defining an UML-like Association, to be displayed as edge:

[source, antlr]
----
Association:
	name=ID
	target=TypeRef
;

// also used at lots of other places
TypeRef:
	lowerBound=INT '..' upperBound=INT type=[Type]
;
----

Note that `TypeRef.type` is mandatory.

Example model:
----
	wheels 1..4 RubberWheel
----

We want to ignore `target.type` for `Association` (as <<ignoredNestedFeatures, described>>) and use the following adjusted grammar:

[source, antlr]
----
Association:
	name=ID
	target=AssociationTypeRef
;

AssociationTypeRef returns TypeRef:
	lowerBound=INT '..' upperBound=INT
;

// also used at lots of other places
TypeRef:
	lowerBound=INT '..' upperBound=INT type=[Type]
;
----

This won't work, because the Xtext serializer refuses to serialize a model if it cannot find a grammar rule for a mandatory feature.

We solve this by registering a special `org.eclipse.xtext.serializer.sequencer.TransientValueService` to our adjusted grammar:

[source, java]
----
public class InlineEditRuntimeModule extends org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.AbstractInlineEditRuntimeModule {
	public Class<? extends ITransientValueService> bindSerializerTransientValueService() {
		return com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime.ignoredfeature.IgnoredFeatureTransientValueService.class;
	}
}
----


[[constrainGlobalScope]]
=== Constrain the Global Scope to all Ecore Resources from the Sirius Session

Sirius has its own link:https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/developer/Architecture.html#session[session management], including the contained Ecore resources.
We might want to limit the Xtext editor's global scope to these resources.

A special `org.eclipse.xtext.scoping.IGlobalScopeProvider` achieves this:

[source, java]
----
public class InlineEditRuntimeModule extends org.eclipse.xtext.example.fowlerdsl.AbstractInlineEditRuntimeModule {
	public Class<? extends IGlobalScopeProvider> bindIGlobalScopeProvider() {
		return com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime.resource.XtextSiriusResourceSetGlobalScopeProvider.class;
	}
}
----

CAUTION: This copies the contents of all Ecore resources from a Sirius session when showing an Xtext/Sirius editor.
Depending on the number and size of the resources, the processing and memory performance might be significant.


[[duplicateEKeyValidator]]
=== More Detailed Validation of Duplicate EKeys

EMF's default validator `EObjectValidator` raises an issue if a list contains more than one element with the same _EKey_.
However, the error message is not always helpful, and it's assigned to the complete container.

We provide an additional validator `com.altran.general.integration.xtextsirius.runtime.validator.DuplicateEKeyValidatorFast` to fix the described limitations.
